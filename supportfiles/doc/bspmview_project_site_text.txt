### About
*bspmview* is a graphical user interface for overlaying, thresholding, and visualizing 3D statistical neuroimages in MATLAB. It currently requires a number of core functions from the MATLAB software [Statistical Parametric Mapping] (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), and indeed will work best with the statistical images produced using SPM. Note that it has only been tested on SPM8/SPM12. 

*bspmview* was directly inspired by and in some cases incorporates code from from two other statistical image viewers: [xjview](http://www.alivelearn.net/xjview8/developers/) and [FIVE](http://mrtools.mgh.harvard.edu/index.php/Main_Page). The idea behind bspmview was to integrate and improve some of the great features of these two viewing programs in an interface that I find to be more intuitive, accessible, and customizable. Most importantly, all of its features require **no additional third-party software** (other than SPM, of course). These features include: 
* reads .img/.hdr, .nii, and .nii.gz
* can read non-statistical/non-intensity images (e.g., binary mask, ROIs, or count images)
* quickly switch display of contrast sign (+, -, or +/-)
* uncorrected and corrected image thresholding, including SPM-benchmarked familywise error rate (FWE) correction at both voxel and cluster levels
* automatic anatomical labeling with the Anatomy Toolbox or Harvard Oxford atlases
* generate interactive table of labeled activation peaks, and save (potentially) publication-ready tables to CSV 
* quickly generate beautiful and customizable surface renderings
* save thresholded whole-brain maps or specific clusters as either intensity images or binary masks
* save region-of-interest images by growing spheres/boxes around a coordinate (and optionally intersect the sphere/box with thresholded overlay image)
* many colormap options
* and other random features, such using [Neurosynth](http://neurosynth.org/locations/) to examine functional connectivity and coactivation maps for the current coordinate

### Installation
1. Download the software
2. Put the *bspmview* folder either on your MATLAB path or in the "toolboxes" subfolder of your SPM installation. Note that only the parent folder needs to be on the path. The subfolder "supportfiles" is added to the MATLAB path whenever you run bspmview.

### Launching *bspmview*
If you put bspmview in the "toolboxes" subfolder of your SPM installation, you will be able to launch *bspmview* by selecting it from the "Toolbox:" dropdown menu in the SPM graphical user interface. Otherwise, as long as bspmview is on your MATLAB path you can start it from the command line by entering: 
```
>> bspmview                    
```
This will open a file selection dialogue window with which you can select the overlay image you'd like to display:

You can also give bspmview filenames for overlay and underlay images as arguments. The following will display the overlay *spmT_0001.img* on the default underlay (this example assumes that the image is in your working directory; otherwise, you'd need to enter the full path): 
```
>> bspmview('spmT_0001.img') 
```
This will overlay *spmT_0001.img* on to *T1.nii*:
``` 
>> bspmview('spmT_0001.img', 'T1.nii') 
```
